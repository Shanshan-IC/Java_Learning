# JUnitTest
Using JUnit to test java codes

This is the example for junit to test java codes

Calculate.java: is the class that we are going to test

CalculateTest.java: is testing the method in Calculate class

AnnotationsTest.java: is testing execution procedure

AssertionsTest.java: is using methods in assert class

timetest.java: is time test

I add FirstDayAtSchool.java, PrepareMyBagTest.java and AddPencilsTest.java to show suittest.java.(suittest means bundle a few unit test cases and run it together.)

CalculateTest2.java: is Parameterized tests.(allow developer to run the same test over and over again using different values.)

NOTE: Please remember to add JUnit 4 library
